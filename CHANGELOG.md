0.13.0 Release notes (2016-5-19)
=============================================================
### Breaking changes
* With this release we have switched over to a new cross platform compatible date format.
  This change will only require action from users who are using both the JS and Cocoa or Android
  bindings simultaneously and accessing Realm files from both bindings. In these cases you need to
  open the Realm file with the latest version of the iOS or Android bindings before accessing the
  Realm from JS to prevent an unnecessary conversion.

### Enhancements
* None

### Bugfixes
* Date properties are now stored in a format compatible with the Realm Browser and other bindings.
* Fix for using `class MyObject extends Realm.Object` in a React Native project.
* Fix a memory leak caused by constructing a Realm instance of an already opened Realm.
* Fix for better supporting hot module reloading.
* Fix for some warnings when using `ListView` with React Native 0.25+
* Fix for queries that use a keypath starting with "not".

  - **Note:** Custom object classes can extend `Realm.Object` to inherit this method
* Support opening a Realm as read-only with the `readOnly` configuration option
* Support for providing a custom migration function (please see the docs for details)
* Added `path`, `readOnly`, `schema`, and `schemaVersion` properties to `Realm` instances
* Optional and list properties are no longer required when creating objects

### Bugfixes
* When accessing an empty Results `undefined` is returned rather than throwing an exception
* Accessing a deleted object throws a JS exception rather than crashing
* Accessing an invalidated Results snapshot throws a JS exception rather than crashing
* Fix for error message when specifying properties with invalid object types
